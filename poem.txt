1 Oh sunflower! The queen of all flowers,\n 2 No other with you can compare, \n 3 The roadside and fields are made golden \n 4 Because of your bright presence there. \n 5 Above all the weeds that surround you \n 6 You raise to the sun your bright head, \n 7 Embroidering beautiful landscapes \n 8 Your absence would leave brown and dead.
